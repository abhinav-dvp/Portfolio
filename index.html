           When I was in my 7th grade I got my first computer I was very fond of tech from the very begining but when I got my computer it was  <br>
           one day while playing video game A thought came into my mind "Why cant I came games of my own!!!"<br>
           I will have a blank canvas in which I can write whatever I want I felt that freedom<br>
           I watched youtube videos and learned coding in Unity that is when I learned c# <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           Benifits : got introduced to programing world <br>
                    : Learned c# <br>

        <div class= "Step2text">
          <h1 class = "Step2head"> Started getting official records of progress </h1>
          Now I knew what programming was and I had thought of making it my carrer so I started working on it and took Computer science classes in my high school.<br>
          I also did some learning outside my class I learned HTML and CSS using online learnign platforms like edx and coursera when I was in my 9th or 10th grade. <Br>
          Now I was eligible to take computer science classes in my high school so I took C.S in y 11 th grade and my 12th grade at that time I learned python and SQl <br>
          Not only this I learned theoretical conecepts like networking and just if I forgot to mention I stoped using windows when I was in my 10th grade and started Linux <br>
          I know this list is getting too big but I learned javascript while I was in my high school <br>
          <br>
          <br>
           Benifits : advanced in this programming word <br>
                    : Learned HTML,CSS,Python,SQL,Networking,Javascript <br>

          <h1 class = "Step3head"> Came to USA and Enrolled in IWU </h1>
          I completed My high school and now it was time for college and to advance my carrer by gaining practicle knowledge not just theoretical knowledge I came to IWU <br>
          I enrolled here as a computer science but I also wanted to get enrolled in engineering pathway so with the hep of my advisors I did so. <br>
          I am currently taking : Computational Discrete Mathematics(CS 136) which is a sophomore level course in which we learn about computational maths. <br>
          Physics 105 , Calculus 176 and also by the end of this spring semester I would complete computer science in which we learn C++<br>
          I am also trying to learn AWS right now <br>
